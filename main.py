    Players take alternating turns placing symbols on the tiles of the grid to move there.

    Once one of the players scores three in a row, column or diagonal on the board, that player wins the game. 
    If the board becomes filled up and neither player has won, the game is ended in a draw.
                          
    The computer's tiles are denoted by a O, while the player's tiles are denoted by an X.
